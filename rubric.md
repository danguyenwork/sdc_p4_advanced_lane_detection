The Goal of this Project
In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. The camera calibration images, test road images, and project videos are available in the project repository.

The Writeup
The writeup will be the primary output you submit (along with your code of course).

Within the project repository, there is a writeup template that you can use as a starting point for your project writeup.

A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point. You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where appropriate) and links to other supporting documents or external references. You should also include images in your writeup to illustrate how your code works.

All that said, please be concise! We're not looking for you to write a book, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :)

You are not required to use Markdown for your writeup. If you use another method, please just submit a PDF of your writeup.

The Code
Your code should stand on its own as readable material. Explain in code comments, as well as in your writeup, how your code works and why you wrote it that way.

Make it easy for a reviewer to understand your code.

You are more than welcome to use code from the lesson. But if you copy something explain how it works and why you used it.

What It Takes to Pass
Read the project rubric for details on the requirements for a passing submission.

Your writeup should include each rubric point and your description of how you addressed that point in your submission. The project repo provides an example template for your writeup.

There is no starter code provided, but you are welcome to use code from the lesson and quizzes as you like. You may complete the project in a Jupyter notebook, but it's not required. Feel free to build it as a standalone project.

To help the reviewer evaluate your project, please save example images from each stage of your pipeline to the output_images folder and provide in your writeup a description of each image. Please also save your output video and include it with your submission.

Evaluation
Once you have completed your project, double check the Project Rubric to make sure you have addressed all the rubric points. Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to that same rubric.

Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Submission
What to Include
Include a zipped file with your:

writeup
code (or a Jupyter notebook)
example output images
output video
Alternatively, you may submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project.

In either case, remember to include example images for each stage of your pipeline and your final output video in your submission.

Using GitHub and Creating Effective READMEs
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub , Udacity has a brief GitHub tutorial to get you started. Udacity also provides a more detailed free course on git and GitHub.

To learn about REAMDE files and Markdown, Udacity provides a free course on READMEs, as well.

GitHub also provides a tutorial about creating Markdown files.
